# Dungeon-Builder-in-Python

## Synopsis
A very simple dungeon-builder in Python along with a pathfinding algorithm (A*) for it.

## Motivation
I made this very small project to both practice python and dungeon-building algorithms, which is a very important skill in roguelike development, for example.

## Features
* Generate random rooms in a grid
* Connect the rooms in the grid with corridors
 
# TODO List
* __TODO__: Randomly generate items ($) and monsters (&) in the dungeon
* __TODO__: Spawn a hero (@) in a random position
* __TODO__: Create an exit (E) in another random position in the map
* __TODO__: Mark the path from the hero's initial position to the exit using dots (.)
